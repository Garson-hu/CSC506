* Cache Coherence Simulator with MESI and MOESI Protocols
** Overview
This project implements a cache coherence simulator for a multiprocessor system using the MESI and MOESI protocols. The simulator models cache behavior across multiple processors, supporting realistic evaluation of:

- Read and write operations with cache hits and misses.
- Cache invalidations during coherence actions.
- Memory transactions, including flushes and write-backs.
- Execution time estimation based on latency for various operations.
